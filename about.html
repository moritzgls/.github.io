        <h1>My Background</h1>
        <p>Hi, I work on predicting the multi-faceted effect of mutations using Protein Language Models and Graph Neural Nets. 
          I'm interested in general AI research such as reinforcement learning, Language and Graphs models as well as Diffusion and Flow Matching.</p>
      <p>I conducted clinical lung cancer research during high school (cf. <li><a href="papers.html">publications</a></li>) and I am still working on a project in cooperation with my mentor PD Dr. Matthias Scheffler from the University Hospital of Cologne.</p>
      <p>Informal and formal education: for coding and ML I am self-taught and greatly benefited from Andrej Karpathy's from zero to hero tutorials:) Currently, I study Medicine at Charité - University Hospital Berlin and Computer Science at Technical University Berlin</p>

        <h1>My Skills</h1>
       <h2>ML Research and Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>In my work on predicting mutation effects with Protein-Language Model based deep learning models, I have gained proficiency in PyTorch and in different deep learning building blocks such as Transformer decoders, CNNs and Graph Nets to model protein structure. I learned Data Analysis by my cancer research projects where I used R for survival analysis and plotting, as well as SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas etc. for statistical analysis and visualisation</p>
        <h2>Clinical Research</h2>
        <p>I have gained somewhat expertise on the treatment of cancer patients, targeted therapy in lung cancer as well as tumor genomics through my clinical and preclinical cancer research.</p>
       <h2>Preclinical Research</h2>
      <p>During my 2 months internship in the Brägelmann Lab at the Department of Translational Genomics of the University Cologne I established a platform for ROS1 mutation testing where i gained wet lab skills such as qPCR, Gibbson Cloning, Site-directed Mutagenesis, transformation in E. coli, cell culture, virus production, Western Blot and several other assays</p>
