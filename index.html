            <p>Hi, I work on <strong>predicting the multi-faceted effect of mutations using Protein Language Models and Graph Neural Nets</strong>.
                I'm interested in general AI research such as Language and Graph models, reinforcement learning as well as Diffusion and Flow Matching.</p>
            <p>I conducted clinical lung cancer research during high school (cf. <a href="#publications">publications</a>) and I am still working on a project in cooperation with my mentor PD Dr. Matthias Scheffler from the University Hospital of Cologne.</p>
            <p>Informal and formal education: for coding and ML I am self-taught and greatly benefited from Andrej Karpathy's from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ">from zero to hero</a> tutorials:) Currently, I study <em>Medicine</em> at <em>Charité - University Hospital Berlin</em> and <em>Computer Science</em> at <em>Technical University Berlin</em>.</p>

        <h1>My Skills</h1>
        <h2>ML Research and Data Analysis</h2>
        <div class="text-box">
            <p>In my work on <strong>predicting mutation effects with Protein-Language Model</strong> based deep learning models, I have gained proficiency in <strong>PyTorch</strong> and in different <strong>deep learning building blocks</strong> such as Transformer decoders, CNNs and Graph Nets to model protein structure. I learned Data Analysis by my cancer research projects where I used R for survival analysis and plotting, as well as <strong>SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas</strong> etc. for statistical analysis and visualisation.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Clinical Research</h2>
        <div class="text-box">
            <p>I have gained somewhat expertise on the <strong>treatment of cancer patients, targeted therapy</strong> in lung cancer as well as <strong>tumor genomics</strong> through my clinical and preclinical cancer research.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Preclinical Research</h2>
        <div class="text-box">
            <p>During my 2 months research internship in the <a href="https://www.braegelmannlab.com/"><em>Brägelmann Lab</em></a> at the <em>Department of Translational Genomics</em> of the <em>University of Cologne</em> I <strong>established a platform for ROS1 mutation testing</strong> where I gained wet lab skills such as qPCR, Gibbson Cloning, Site-directed Mutagenesis, transformation in E. coli, cell culture, virus production, Western Blot and several other assays.</p>
